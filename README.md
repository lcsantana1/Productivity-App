  ## Description
  
  Hello and welcome to the Productivity App! This is a collaborative MERN-stack single-page application, combined with a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end.
  This application was designed to help create, delete, and save tasks. When you visit the application, you are able to create a account that will allow you to login and start creating tasks, view previous ones stored, and cross them off as you go.
